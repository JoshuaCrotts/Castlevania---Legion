Castlevania Legion is a spinoff of my original Castlevania game from my AP Computer Science A course. This, on the other hand, was written as the conclusion to my AP Computer Science Principles class. Using my Standards library as the backend (built off of Java Swing), Andrew Matzureff and I wrote the entire game from the ground up, excluding graphical and sound resources. Much of the physics and gravity (including restitution) were made from Andrew, and the level system, entities, AI, items, and animation handlers were created by me. Inputs were handled in a library created by Andrew. This game includes one basic demo level, and a menu screen. Castlevania - Legion was entered into a contest at the end of the (2016-2017) school year with other students' projects/applications, and it won first place of them all.
