Castlevania - Legion is my final project for AP Computer Science Principles; it was a remake of the Castlevania game I did for AP Computer Science A. Both of these games won first place in the voting contests that we did for the course, and I'm quite proud of them! It was written between myself and Andrew Matzureff, big thanks to him. We utilized my original Standards library with modifications to make it work better for this project.
